        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project is to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines using a neural network. <br>
          This webpage provides an overview of the dataset, preprocessing steps, model architecture, training, and evaluation results.</p>

        <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>The dataset consists of 60 numerical features and labels ('Rock' or 'Mine'). Below are the first few rows of the dataset:</p>
        <div class="data-table">
          <!-- Placeholder for the dataset table -->
          <table>
            <tr><th>Feature_1</th><th>Feature_2</th><th>...</th><th>Label</th></tr>
            <tr><td>0.02</td><td>0.03</td><td>...</td><td>Rock</td></tr>
            <tr><td>0.15</td><td>0.22</td><td>...</td><td>Mine</td></tr>

          <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
          <p>A 3-dimenisonal version of the 60-dimensional data is shown using Princple Component Analysis, a technique used to reduce dimensionality.</p>

            <!-- Placeholder for the model diagram -->
            <img src="static/pca.svg" alt="Data Vis">
            <p>This shows the complex data set in 3 dimensions. One can see that there is no clear pattern that makes for easy classification, which makes this a good challenge for a neural network.</p>

    <section class="model">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Model Overview</h2>
        <p>The neural network is composed of an input layer, a hidden layer with 32 nodes, and an output layer. Below is a diagram of the architecture:</p>
        <div class="model-diagram">
          <!-- Placeholder for the model diagram -->
          <img src="static/nna.png" alt="Model Architecture">
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class = "container-lower">
         <p>Inside the hidden layer, the darker colored boxes represent the activation function used, which is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function. <br>
          The output layer uses the Sigmoid activation function to produce a probability value between 0 and 1. <br> </p>
          <div class = "separator"></div>
         <p>An activation function takes in a value and non-linearly transforms it to a desired range, usually between [-1, 1] or 0 and 1. <br>
          Neural Networks work by combining connections between nodes, where each connection has a weight associated with it. <br> </p>
          <div class = "separator"></div>
         <p>After running cycles of training (epochs), the model learns to make accurate predictions by adjusting the weights to minimize the loss function. <br>
          This, combined with the nonlinearlity of activation functions, are what make neural networks so powerful.
         </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="training">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Training and Loss Curves</h2>
        <p>The model was trained for 50 epochs, with loss curves for training and test datasets shown below:</p>
        <div class="training-graph">
          <!-- Placeholder for loss curves -->
          <img src="static/loss_curves.png" alt="Loss Curves">
        </div>
        <p>The model steadily gets better overtime, but doesn't overfit the training data.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="evaluation">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <p>The confusion matrix and classification report provide insights into model performance:</p>
        <div class="confusion-matrix">
          <!-- Placeholder for confusion matrix -->
          <img src="static/Confusion_matrix_C.png" alt="Confusion Matrix">
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class = "container-lower">
        <p>The confusion matrix can be hard to understand at first glance, but the idea is simple. <br> 
          Looking at the top right box (white), this cell tells us that the model thought 1 object was a mine when it was actually a rock. <br>
          The bottom right box (normal blue) tells us that the model correctly predicted 15 objects that were mines as mines. <br>
          Similarily, the top left box (dark blue) tells us that the model correctly predicted 21 objects that were rocks as rocks. <br>
          The bottom left box (very light blue) tells us that the model thought 5 objects were rocks when they actually were mines. <br>
         </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class = "evaluation">
        <div class="container-lower">
          <!-- Placeholder for classification report -->
          <h2>Classification Report:</h2>
          <pre>
                    Precision  Recall  F1-Score  Support
            Rock      0.95    0.90      0.93      50
            Mine      0.92    0.96      0.94      50
          </pre>
          <p>The classification report is a more human-readable version of the confusion matrix. <br>
            It provides metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. <br> </p>
            <div class = "separator"></div>
          <p>Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. <br>
            Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives. <br>
            F1-score is the weighted average of precision and recall. <br> </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This project aimed to educate the general audience about neural networks for (binary) classification while demonstrating the effectiveness of a simple neural network in classifying sonar signals. <br>
          As is shown through the training loss graph, the model steadily improves over time, and the confusion matrix and classification report show that the model performs well on the test data. <br>
          This means that the model is able to generalize well to unseen data, which is a key goal in machine learning. <br>
          Future work could involve exploring more advanced models, more advanced tasks, or additional feature engineering.</p>
